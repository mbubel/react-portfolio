        Born and raised in Rancho San Diego, I spent most of my childhood either
        playing some sort of video game or skateboarding with my friends.{" "}

      My first discovery of any type of wed developement was fixing up my
      Myspace. Although it's the most basic of CSS, I always loved doing it.

        I've been working in the Shipping/Receiving industry for nearly 14
        years, but I decided mid 2020 that I needed a change. Insert the UCSD
        Bootcamp Program!

        My hobbies still include playing video games, but I've retired the
        skateboarding. When I'm not behind a computer, you can catch me at a
        local bar or restaurant, or camping with my buddies. Nothing beats
        sitting around a campfire, beer in hand, and stories to tell.{" "}
